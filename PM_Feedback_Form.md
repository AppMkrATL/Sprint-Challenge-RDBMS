The application lets users track Projects and Actions:

## MVP

- [ ] Build the database and tables using knex migrations. Seeding is not needed.
- [ ] Build the API to perform CRUD operations on projects and actions.
- [ ] Build an endpoint to retrieve a project by its id that returns an object 

## Stretch Problem
- [ ] Use knext to add data seeding scripts for projects and actions.
- [ ] Add support for the concept of contexts.
- [ ] When retrieving an action by id, add a property that lists all the contexts related to that action.
